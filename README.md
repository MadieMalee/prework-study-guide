# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide was a beginner assignment for learning how to navigate and use HTML, Java, CSS, and Git. I built this project in order to learn the basics of coding and the platforms we will be using to download, share, and upload it. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide can be used later to refresh memory and look over old notes from each section. For example if you open the study guide webpage and navigate to Chrome DevTools there will be a list of topics we learned throughout the prework homework.

## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
